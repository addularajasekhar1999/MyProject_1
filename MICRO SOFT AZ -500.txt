1. Your company recently created an Azure subscription.
You have been tasked with making sure that a specified user is able to implement Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM).
Which of the following is the role you should assign to the user?
A. The Global administrator role. Most Voted
B. The Security administrator role.
C. The Password administrator role.
D. The Compliance administrator role.
 
Correct Answer: A üó≥Ô∏è
To start using PIM in your directory, you must first enable PIM.
1. Sign in to the Azure portal as a Global Administrator of your directory.
You must be a Global Administrator with an organizational account (for example, @yourdomain.com), not a Microsoft account (for example, @outlook.com), to enable PIM for a directory.
Scenario: Technical requirements include: Enable Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for contoso.com

2. The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements.
Your company has an Active Directory forest with a single domain, named weylandindustries.com. They also have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant with the same name.
You have been tasked with integrating Active Directory and the Azure AD tenant. You intend to deploy Azure AD Connect.
Your strategy for the integration must make sure that password policies and user logon limitations affect user accounts that are synced to the Azure AD tenant, and that the amount of necessary servers are reduced.
Solution: You recommend the use of pass-through authentication and seamless SSO with password hash synchronization.
Does the solution meet the goal?
A. Yes Most Voted
B. No
 
Correct Answer: B üó≥Ô∏è
For pass-through authentication, you need one or more (we recommend three) lightweight agents installed on existing servers. These agents must have access to your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services, including your on-premises AD domain controllers. They need outbound access to the Internet and access to your domain controllers. For this reason, it's not supported to deploy the agents in a perimeter network.

Your strategy for the integration must make sure that password policies and user logon limitations affect user accounts that are synced to the Azure AD tenant, and that the amount of necessary servers are reduced.
Solution: You recommend the use of federation with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).
Does the solution meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No Most Voted
 
Correct Answer: B üó≥Ô∏è
A federated authentication system relies on an external trusted system to authenticate users. Some companies want to reuse their existing federated system investment with their Azure AD hybrid identity solution. The maintenance and management of the federated system falls outside the control of Azure AD. It's up to the organization by using the federated system to make sure it's deployed securely and can handle the authentication load.

Password hash synchronization requires the least effort regarding deployment, maintenance, and infrastructure. This level of effort typically applies to organizations that only need their users to sign in to Office 365, SaaS apps, and other Azure AD-based resources. When turned on, password hash synchronization is part of the Azure AD Connect sync process and runs every two minutes.

Topic 2 - Question Set 2



44.  This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.
After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.
You have an Azure subscription named Sub1.
You have an Azure Storage account named sa1 in a resource group named RG1.
Users and applications access the blob service and the file service in sa1 by using several shared access signatures (SASs) and stored access policies.
You discover that unauthorized users accessed both the file service and the blob service.
You need to revoke all access to sa1.
Solution: You create a new stored access policy.
Does this meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No Most Voted
 
Correct Answer: B üó≥Ô∏è
Creating a new (additional) stored access policy with have no effect on the existing policy or the SAS's linked to it.
To revoke a stored access policy, you can either delete it, or rename it by changing the signed identifier. Changing the signed identifier breaks the associations between any existing signatures and the stored access policy. Deleting or renaming the stored access policy immediately effects all of the shared access signatures associated with it.

After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.
You have a hybrid configuration of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
You have an Azure HDInsight cluster on a virtual network.
You plan to allow users to authenticate to the cluster by using their on-premises Active Directory credentials.
You need to configure the environment to support the planned authentication.
Solution: You deploy the On-premises data gateway to the on-premises network.
Does this meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No Most Voted
 
Correct Answer: B üó≥Ô∏è
Instead, you connect HDInsight to your on-premises network by using Azure Virtual Networks and a VPN gateway.
Note: To allow HDInsight and resources in the joined network to communicate by name, you must perform the following actions:
‚úë Create Azure Virtual Network.
‚úë Create a custom DNS server in the Azure Virtual Network.
‚úë Configure the virtual network to use the custom DNS server instead of the default Azure Recursive Resolver.
‚úë Configure forwarding between the custom DNS server and your on-premises DNS server.

47.Your network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. The forest contains a single domain.
You have an Azure subscription named Sub1 that is associated to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named contoso.com.
You plan to deploy Azure AD Connect and to integrate Active Directory and the Azure AD tenant.
You need to recommend an integration solution that meets the following requirements:
‚úë Ensures that password policies and user logon restrictions apply to user accounts that are synced to the tenant
‚úë Minimizes the number of servers required for the solution.
Which authentication method should you include in the recommendation?
A. federated identity with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
B. password hash synchronization with seamless single sign-on (SSO)
C. pass-through authentication with seamless single sign-on (SSO) Most Voted
 
Correct Answer: B üó≥Ô∏è
Password hash synchronization requires the least effort regarding deployment, maintenance, and infrastructure. This level of effort typically applies to organizations that only need their users to sign in to Office 365, SaaS apps, and other Azure AD-based resources. When turned on, password hash synchronization is part of the Azure AD Connect sync process and runs every two minutes.
Incorrect Answers:
A: A federated authentication system relies on an external trusted system to authenticate users. Some companies want to reuse their existing federated system investment with their Azure AD hybrid identity solution. The maintenance and management of the federated system falls outside the control of Azure AD. It's up to the organization by using the federated system to make sure it's deployed securely and can handle the authentication load.
C: For pass-through authentication, you need one or more (we recommend three) lightweight agents installed on existing servers. These agents must have access to your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services, including your on-premises AD domain controllers. They need outbound access to the Internet and access to your domain controllers. For this reason, it's not supported to deploy the agents in a perimeter network.
Pass-through Authentication requires unconstrained network access to domain controllers. All network traffic is encrypted and limited to authentication requests.

If you do so, all users, groups, or service principals who had role based access (RBAC) to manage subscriptions and its resources lose their access. Only the user in the new account who accepts your transfer request will have access to manage the resources.
